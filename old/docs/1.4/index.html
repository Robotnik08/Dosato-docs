        <h1>1.4 Conditionals</h1>

        <h2>if</h2>

        <p>
            The master keyword <code>if</code> is used to create a conditional statement. <br>
        </p>

        <pre>
<code class="language-dosato">if password == "1234" then {
    do say ("Access granted")    
} else {
    do say ("Access denied")
}</code></pre>

        <p>
            if is followed by a boolean expression, the <code>then</code> keyword and a block of code and an optional else block. <br>
            The boolean expression is evaluated and if it is true, the block of code before is executed. <br>
            If the boolean expression is false, the else block is executed. <br>
            Example of an if statement with an else extension:
        </p>

        <pre>
<code class="language-dosato">if password == "1234" then {
    do say ("Access granted")
} else if password == "4321" then {
    do say ("Access granted with alternative password")
} else {
    do say ("Access denied")
}</code></pre>

        <p>
            Here password must be equal to "1234" for the first block to be executed. <br>
            If password is equal to "4321" the second block is executed. <br>
            If password is not equal to "1234" or "4321" the else block is executed. <br>
        </p>
            


        <h2>when</h2>

        <p>
            The extension keyword <code>when</code> is also used to create a conditional statement. <br>
        </p>

        <!-- Code block -->
        <pre>
<code class="language-dosato">do {
    do say ("Access granted")
} when password == "1234"</code></pre>

        <p>
            when is used to create a conditional statement. <br>
            when is followed by a boolean expression, a block of code and an optional else block. <br>
            The boolean expression is evaluated and if it is true, the block of code before is executed. <br>
            If the boolean expression is false, the else block is executed. <br>
            Example of a when statement with an else extension:
        </p>


        <!-- Code block -->
        <pre>
<code class="language-dosato">do {
    do say ("Access granted")
} when password == "1234" else {
    do say ("Access denied")
}</code></pre>


        <h2>unless</h2>

        <p>
            The extension keyword <code>unless</code> is also used to create a conditional statement. <br>
            It's the same as when, but the boolean expression is inverted. <br>
        </p>

        <!-- Code block -->
        <pre>
<code class="language-dosato">do {
    do say ("Access denied")
} unless password == "1234"</code></pre>
        

        <h2>Boolean operators</h2>

        <p>
            Boolean operators are used to compare values. <br>
            Boolean operators return a boolean value. (true or false) <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Common boolean operators are: <br>
            <code>==</code> equal to <br>
            <code>!=</code> not equal to <br>
            <code>></code> greater than <br>
            <code><</code> less than <br>
            <code>>=</code> greater than or equal to <br>
            <code><=</code> less than or equal to <br>
            <code>&&</code> and <br>
            <code>||</code> or <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Example of a boolean expression:
        </p>

        <!-- Code block -->
        <pre>
<code class="language-dosato">if password == "1234" && username == "Robotnik" then {
    do say ("Access granted")
}</code></pre>

        <p>
            Here password must be equal to "1234" and username must be equal to "Robotnik" for the block to be executed. <br>
            here's another example:
        </p>

        <!-- Code block -->
        <pre>
<code class="language-dosato">if password == "1234" || password == "4321" then {
    do say ("Access granted")
}</code></pre>

        <p>
            Here password must be equal to "1234" or "4321" for the block to be executed. <br>
            here's another example:
        </p>

        <!-- Code block -->
        <pre>
<code class="language-dosato">if age >= 18 then {
    do say ("Access granted")
}</code></pre>

        <p>
            Here age (variable) must be greater or equal to 18 for the block to be executed. <br>

        </p>

        <h2>extension keywords</h2>

        <p>
            On a more advanced note, when and is is actually extension keywords. <br>
            extension keywords are functionality that can be added to a master keyword. <br>
        </p>

        <div class="info">
            <p>
                <strong>Info!</strong> <br>
                When vs if <br>
                When and if both act as conditionals, but when and if act very differently. <br><br>

                When encapsulates all code before it, so if the condition is false, ALL the code before it is not executed. <br>
                If only encapsulates the block of code after it, so if the condition is false, only the block of code after it is not executed. <br><br>

                Now, extensions can be put on any master keyword, not only do. <br>
                This means you can do quick conditionals with set, return, break and more. <br>
                <pre><code class="language-dosato">set number = 5 when condition
return number unless condition</code></pre>
                This is something if can't do like this. <br>
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            We'll learn more about do extensions in a later chapter <a href="../1.6/index.html">1.6 Extensions and loops</a>. <br>
