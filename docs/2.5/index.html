        <h1>2.5 Including and Importing</h1>

        <p>
            Dosato has a system for including and importing files. <br>
            This is useful for splitting up your code into multiple files, and reusing code. <br>
            The syntax for including a file is as follows: <code>include "filename"</code> <br>
            The syntax for importing a file is as follows: <code>import "libraryname"</code> <br>
            You can only import and include on a top level. <br>
        </p>

        <h2>Including files</h2>

        <p>
            Including files is useful for splitting up your code into multiple files. <br>
            This can make your code more readable and maintainable. <br>
            To include a file, use the <code>include</code> keyword followed by the filename in quotes. <br>
            Example: <code>include "myfile.to"</code> <br>
            The file will be run, and the functions will become available. <br>
        </p>

        <h2>Importing libraries</h2>

        <p>
            Dosato has support for external libraries written in C or other low level languages. <br>
            To import a library, use the <code>import</code> keyword followed by the library name in quotes. <br>
            Example: <code>import "mylibrary"</code> <br>
            The library will be loaded and the functions will become available. <br>
            More information on how to write libraries can be found in the Dosato library documentation. <br>
