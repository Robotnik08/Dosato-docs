The Dosato Standard library is a collection of built-in functions and constants that are available by default in the Dosato programming language. It provides a wide range of functionality, including mathematical operations, string manipulation, and data structure handling. The standard library is designed to be easy to use and efficient, allowing developers to quickly build applications without having to write everything from scratch.

The following chapters will cover the standard library in detail, including the available functions, constants, and how to use them effectively. The standard library is divided into several sections, each focusing on a specific area of functionality.
