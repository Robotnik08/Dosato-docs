## What is Dosato?

Dosato is a general-purpose programming language that is designed to be simple and easy to use, while also allowing for powerful and complex code. It is designed to be easy to learn, and easy to use, while also being powerful and flexible. Due to it's interpreted nature, it is a high-level language, support both object-oriented and procedural programming. It also supports both static and dynamic typing, and has a powerful and rich standard library.

## Why Dosato?

Dosato as a language can be seen as a powerful high level language, which is easy to learn but hard to master. It has a focus on a new concept; Master Keywords, which are a set of keywords dictating the lines of code and their purpose. Not only does this make the code more readable, it also allows for dosato to get rid of the need for semicolons while still being able to support any whitespace style.

Here are a few small examples of what dosato can do:

```dosato
// Hello World
do sayln("Hello, World!")
```

```dosato
// 100 times
do sayln(i) for i in range(100)
```

```dosato
// Fibonacci
define long fib (long n) {
    make a, b = 0, 1
    set a, b = b, a + b for range(n)
    return a
}
do sayln(fib(15)) // 610
```
